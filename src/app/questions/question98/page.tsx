                <p className="pl-6 pr-6 mb-6">Thai food is very different from what you may have tasted before. The main flavors in Thai food are salty, spicy, sour, and sweet. It is important to try these different flavorings to get a good feel for what Thai food is like. Thai food often pairs hot spices with sweet, light citrus flavors like lime and mango. The signature peanut sauce is somewhere between sweet and savory and adds depth to any dish. The layered flavors of Thai food make each dish feel completely unique and is what sets it apart from dishes in other Asian cuisines. Generally, Thais order the same number of dishes as there are people in the group. However, the dishes are shared between all members of the group. This ensures that all members get a taste of all the flavors. Usually, there will be a soup, several different meats, vegetable stir-fry, noodles, and a dessert.
